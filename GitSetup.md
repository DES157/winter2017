Git Basics
==========


__Mac__ users should have `git` installed already. __Windows__ users should install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and accept the installer defaults. Make sure that "Use Git Bash only" is selected when you reach that part of the installer.


Setting up Git
--------------

### Setting Variables

Before you begin it's good to let Git know who you are.  From Terminal (OS X) or Git Bash (Windows) type these commands with your information:

```
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

See [First-Time Git Setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) for more details.
