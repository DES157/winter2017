##### How do I rename my repository?

See [Renaming a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/renaming-a-repository/) for instructions on how to rename your repository on GitHub.

If you rename your repository or configured your remote incorrectly you can update it by:

    git remote set-url origin <newurl>
