GitHub Pages
============

Host Web Pages On GitHub
------------------------

These instructions should get your web page hosted on GitHub Pages. This process only needs to be followed once for your initial setup.

#### Starting from scratch

We will assume that your code is not yet under version control. If it is then skip to the section below.

Before you follow these steps you should set up Git as described [here](GitSetup).

1. Make sure all of your files are in a folder (e.g. named `ex1`).

    From Terminal (OS X) or Git Bash (Windows) change to that directory:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/ex1
    ```

   Note: you will need to replace `path/to/ex1` with the actual path to the directory containing your files. E.g. `cd ~/Desktop/ex1` if the directory is on your desktop. Type `ls` to see that your files are there, and `pwd` to see its path.

2. As demonstrated in class, create a new repository on GitHub by following the instructions on [Creating a new repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/). Make repository _public_ and do not choose any of the other options.

    You will need to create a new repository on GitHub for each exercise you do, so change `ex1` to the appropriate name as you follow these instructions.

3. Follow instructions on [Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/).

    Note: Repositories can be accessed by HTTPS or SSH. Unless you have experience with SSH you should choose the HTTPS option for now.

    If your username is `johndoe` and the repository you created on GitHub is called `ex1` then issuing the following commands will create a local git repository, add your files to it, and then push them to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git init
    git checkout --orphan gh-pages
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/ex1.git
    git push -u origin gh-pages
    ```

    Note: if you are using a Mac execute the following line before the above block of code (this will cause Git to ignore unnecessary `.DS_Store` files):
    
    ```bash
    echo .DS_Store > .gitignore
    ```
    
    Your site should now be available on the web at `http://johndoe.github.io/ex1`

    Note: When you host a project site with GitHub Pages the files in the the `gh-pages` branch are served as a web site at `http://USERNAME.github.io/REPO`.

    Optional: after running `git add .` try `git status` to see that your files are listed under "Changes to be committed"
    
#### If your site is already managed by Git

The above instructions take you through the process of creating a new repository from scratch. If you are already using Git to manage your code on your local computer then all you need to do is:

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repo (step 2 above).

2. Create a `gh-pages` branch if you do not have one already:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b gh-pages
    ```
    
    Note: make sure to commit any changes first. You should now be doing your develpment in the `gh-pages` branch (if you do `git branch` you should see `gh-pages` and there should be a `*` by it).

3. Connect your local repository to GitHub and push to it:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/myrepo.git
git push -u origin gh-pages
```

#### Updating your code

Once your repository is set up and synchronized with GitHub see this simple [workflow](GitBasics) for taking snapshots of your code and pushing changes to GitHub.

Hints
-----
##### Link to your page from repo

At the top of your repository page on GitHub (URL like `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO`) you can click `Edit` (_No description or website provided_. â€” Edit) and add the URL of the correponding web site (`https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO/index.html`)

##### Considerations

You use the command `git pull` to bring changes from your remote repsitory (in this case GitHub) into your local repository. When you are working on a project alone and from only one computer you may not ever have to pull, but if you are collaborating with others you should do this often.
